# The Journey

## The Problem

It's frustrating how time consuming it is to _properly_ create a new app or website. This is partly due to the ever evolving nature of application development but also due to a lack of project starter tools and templates that are actually helpful. There are great platforms for creating websites - but often either get expensive or have limits on what you can do.

Projects like `create-react-app` and meta frameworks like NextJS and Expo have done a good job of encapsulating configuration and best practices to simplify things, but there is still so much to build from there.

Most project starter tools and templates will generate a large amount of initial code and then leave it up to you to edit, customize and add on top of it. It can be very time consuming to understand all of the parts of the starter code and follow along with updates as dependencies evolve. If the starter template includes functionality that you don't need for your project, this can be wasteful. I also almost never find templates that build off other starter templates to add additional functionality.

As a solo developer working on freelance and personal projects, I want to reduce the time to stand up and update projects that have all of the best practices I have accumulated. I want to stop doing the same thing each time as much as possible. I also really want to collaborate on the lower-level parts of my applications that are shared between projects and don't have any special business logic. This way I can spread the load of updating things with the open-source community.

## Looking For A Solution

These are the features I wanted:

1. copy files and folders from a source to a destination folder
2. define inputs in the source and shell commands to run after copying
3. replace content in the files when copying based on the inputs
4. replace parts of the filenames and paths based on the inputs
5. define other sources that my source depends on to be installed first
6. maintain a history of sources that were copied along with the inputs that were used
7. replay all of the copy operations using the stored inputs
8. compare differences between current and replayed files

I want the process of creating source templates to be as simple as possible. I also want it to not be tied to a particular programming language so it could work on any type of project and doesn't require installing something like python, ruby or nodejs to run.

I have come across various scaffolding and build tools over the years and thought I'd try to see if any of them had the features I was looking for.

[grunt-init](https://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding) is one of the first tools I can remember using to scaffold web projects. And then [yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) came out a bit later. It's probably still possible to use them. They can satisfy all of the my feature requirements up to maintaining history. It might be possible to extend them to do that. However, they both use javascript code to configure the generator / scaffolding. I want to avoid needing to use code at all. Keep it as simple as possible. I think that will have the best chance of adoption and being useful in the long term.

I have also use Nx before. It has a way to create generator plugins, local generators and update generators. This is pretty close to what I want to do. But I find Nx to a bit complicated and opinionated. Similar to yeoman, it also requires writing javascript code to define what the generator will do. [https://nx.dev/extending-nx/recipes/local-generators](https://nx.dev/extending-nx/recipes/local-generators)

I wanted to experiment to see if there might be a simpler way - at least for my use case. I started building my own tool. At first, it was a collection of bash scripts that mostly leaned on jq, sed and diff. But I wanted something easier to distribute and the difference in sed versions between different platforms like osx and linux is tough. I ended up rewriting in Rust - mostly because a lot of recent tools have been built in rust and it can build binaries to be distributed so the end user doesn't need to have Rust installed.

I was ever paranoid that I was building a tool that already existed so I continued to search for similar tools. I eventually found scaffolder-cli on npm. [https://github.com/galElmalah/scaffolder](https://github.com/galElmalah/scaffolder) It shares a lot of the same motivation I have and supports some features that I have not built yet. The only downside is that it uses a javascript configuration file which might not be ideal in some situations. It needs a javascript engine to run.

I described my tool to ChatGTP and asked for similar projects. It suggested Lerna, Nx, Rush and Yarn Workspace. I actually hadn't heard of [Rush](https://rushjs.io/) before. It's pretty impressive and has a lot of interesting tools. I revised my prompt a bit and ChatGPT additionally suggested yeoman, hygen, plop.

I don't remember hearing about hygen before. The use of front matter and EJS for templates... but extensibility and ecosystem sound pretty good. It has packages and hygen-create... althought I'm not sure how deep that is. [hygen.io/docs/faq](https://www.hygen.io/docs/faq/)

Next up is Plop. I'm pretty positive I have never heard of this one before either. The "with consistency" tag jumped out at me on the homepage. Handlebars... cool. [plopjs.com/documentation](https://plopjs.com/documentation/) "micro-generator framework" - I like that.

Here are some other projects I have stumbled on. They all didn't quite match what I was looking for either.

- monobuild - [github.com/monobuild/monobuild](https://github.com/monobuild/monobuild)
- bazel - [bazel.build/](https://bazel.build/)
- Renovate bot - [github.com/renovatebot/renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate)
- brix - [crates.io/crates/brix](https://crates.io/crates/brix)
- monofold - [github.com/kschio/monofold-templates](https://github.com/kschio/monofold-templates)
- scaff - [gitlab.com/jD91mZM2/scaff/](https://gitlab.com/jD91mZM2/scaff/)
- inc - [gitlab.com/jD91mZM2/inc](https://gitlab.com/jD91mZM2/inc)
- create-svelte (and create-* npm scripts generally) - [github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/main/packages/create-svelte/scripts/build-templates.js](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/main/packages/create-svelte/scripts/build-templates.js)

### cookiecutter

Github Copilot mentioned "cookiecutter" in an auto-complete when I was typing my README. That sounds vaguely familiar. Gah... I wish I had found this earlier. [github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) It even has replay: [cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/replay.html](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/replay.html)

It doesn't seem to make it easy to replay multiple templates though. It also doesn't seem to have a way to merge when installing over existing files.

I also found Cortex, a commercial developer portal that extends cookiecutter for its scaffolder. It says it adds keeping track of usage so maybe it's possible to replay with updated templates. [www.cortex.io/products/scaffolder](https://www.cortex.io/products/scaffolder)

Cortex disables the use of cookiecutter's hooks and instead requires using their more structured workflow tool.

### moon

I stumbled on this one late as well. [moonrepo.dev/moon](https://moonrepo.dev/moon) - "A task runner and monorepo management tool for the web ecosystem, written in Rust."

I found it was originally called ["monolith" - "a Rust program for managing JavaScript based monorepos"](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/tree/62267e3ccda7a45c2e9355fcbddba577ae54403d#diff-b335630551682c19a781afebcf4d07bf978fb1f8ac04c6bf87428ed5106870f5)

The codegen features are _so_ similar to whhat I was looking for and more. [moonrepo.dev/docs/guides/codegen](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/guides/codegen)

The concept of "file groups" is pretty interesting. [moonrepo.dev/docs/concepts/file-group](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/concepts/file-group)

They also have an interesting guide on typescript - [moonrepo.dev/docs/guides/javascript/typescript-project-refs](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/guides/javascript/typescript-project-refs)

It's a very impressive project. It allows "system tasks" to run arbitrary commands, but has a package manager and more integrated tooling for more secure options.

## Naming

There are a number of similar terms to describe this process. It seems worth defining them here.

- template = generator = source
  - a folder or package that contains files and folders that can be copied to a destination as well as configuration for replacements, dependencies and commands to return.

- scaffold = generate = copy = install
  - the action of copying files and folders from a source to a destination folder, replacing content along the way and running commands

- regenerate = rebuild = reinstall
  - recreating the project by running the same scaffolding commands in a new folder

- workspace = project = monorepo
  - the folder that contains all of your related packages and apps that you are working on

It was pretty difficult to come up with a name for this project that wasn't already taken.

I thought "wolverine" was maybe a clever name since the X-Men character can regenerate. I also considered "molt" which crabs do in order to grow. There's a cRUSTacean theme in the rust community. I think those names are a bit too obtuse though.

Ultimately, "replicator" - like from star trek - seemed like a pretty good fit. You can materaliaze a project, recycle it and create more.

## The End / The Beginning

I decided to publish my tool as replicator-cli. It has proven usable for my personal projects and I would love to get feedback. I have a pretty large roadmap of ideas which I have posted to github as issues for comment.

Once I have gathered some initial feedback, I would like to publish it to crates.io and other package managers and we'll see where things go from there.
